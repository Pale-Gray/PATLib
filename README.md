A simple image loading / audio library for Java

**ABOUT**

PATLib is a simple image loading and audio library for Java.
It just makes loading images and audio a little bit easier.

###**HOW TO USE**

**FOR AUDIO LOADING**

To use the `Audio` class, here are the steps:

Instantiate a new Audio using `Audio [name];`.
Then, in the main method, do this:
`[name] = new Audio("/pathtofile.wav");
all texture and audio files must be in a `res` source folder!!!

There are two methods for playing and stopping audio
`Audio.playAudio();` and `Audio.stopAudio();`

**FOR TEXTURE LOADING**
